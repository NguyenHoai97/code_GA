these are the chilling images of an abandoned amusement park that shut down after a boy lost his arm on a ride 1 
 Dadipark amusement park , Dadizele , Belgium , closed its doors more than 10 - years ago after a young boy had his arm ripped off on the Nautic Jet water ride 1 
 Kris , 28 , captured the eerie pictures of the abandoned rides at the fairground where they were left to rust and covered in graffiti 2 
 he said : ' a boy lost his arm on the nautical jet attraction 14 years ago 1 
 ' after that people started to complain about safety in the park 2 
 ' visitor numbers dwindled and the park closed in 2002 for major renovations , but never reopened 2 
 ' several groups started to try and re-open the park , but their attempts were n't fruitful 0 
 ' there were a lot of plants around because nature had been left to take over 0 
 nature started to reclaim the park , with all of the attractions still intact , but in disrepair 0 
 ' graffiti artists also claimed some of the walls - one hall was used as an impromptu skate - park 1 
 ' history : the park is believed to have closed after a boy lost his arm on a ride halted : despite the park been closed for many years , many rides are still set up fancy a go on this ? the park has been left in a severe state of decay Kris said the amusement park had deteriorated so drastically since being shut down it had to be demolished completely 1 
 he said : ' up until a couple of years ago , everything was still there - but at this moment , everything has been levelled 1 
 ' weirdly enough , there were still a few people there when i took a look around 0 
 ' while it sometimes is completely locked down , the gates were wide open when i arrived 0 
 passage through : most of the rides have now been covered by overgrown trees and bushes is it art ? the abandoned amusement park has been taken over by graffiti Green but not with envy : a thick swamp is in place where a water ride will have been ' a few locals were walking their dog in the park and other urban explorers were wandering around 1 
 ' i 've been in several abandoned places during my lifetime 0 
 i 've also been to theme parks such as Disneyland when only a few hundred guests have been present 0 
 ' it 's only then that you can truly appreciate the beauty of the minds behind these amusement parks - trying to tell a story 0 
 ' fancy this ? a chilling welcome awaits any visitors today to the Dadipark not a pretty picture : all that remains of the amusement park is derelict buildings and memories . 2
